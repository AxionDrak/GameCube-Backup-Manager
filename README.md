# GameCube Backup Manager 0.0.0-2022-ALPHA
**Welcome to the official Wii Backup Manager Website**

GameCube Backup Manager is a program for working with FAT32 (and NTFS) drives to convert ISO files for use in Nintendont.

A partial list of (planned) features is below:

- Write Full ISO, Scrub ISO (DiscEx and GCReEx).
- Read and write Full size (scrubbed) or trimmed ISO/GCM, GCReEx and DiscEx formats with direct conversion.
- Multiboot ISO support.
- Format drives to FAT32 or ExFAT.
- Extract archives files when adding to the files list, or automatically when needed for transfer/conversion.
- Add folders recursively.
- Select Display unit size (auto, MB, GB).
- Hide any drive you don't want to see in the drive menus, format dialog etc.
- Set friendly display names for drives.
- Multi-threaded. Start more than 1 operation at a time. eg. It is possible to copy an ISO file to one drive, while transferring files to another.
- Progress panels will be shown on pages relevant to current operations showing ETA/Total Expected Time, Transfer Speed, Current Transfer Size, Percent Complete.
- Any operation can be paused or interrupted at any time. Safely stop drive transfers, etc., without damaging the file system.
- Buffered transfers for maximum speed (but speed and ETA etc can be erratic because of this).
- An MD5 Hash will be calculated and stored on each disk transferred to a drive, so you can verify data integrity later.
- Show/hide list columns.
- Support for Multi-language GameTDB titles.txt.
- Inline editing of titles and region.
- Use custom-titles.txt to store manual entry edits.
- Enable WiiTDB/Custom titles in the settings dialog.
- Auto rename titles during drive/ISO file transfers.
- Use on-the-fly titles for FAT32/ExFAT files/folders, without changing the internal titles.
- Extract games from GCOS multiboot ISOs to any of the supported formats.
- Save the original file layout to trimmed ISOs, allowing full size ISOs to be rebuilt at a later date with the same file layout as the original.
- Direct drive to drive transfers.
- Multiple folder layouts. Title [GameID], Title_[GameID], GameID_Title
- Multilingual interface.
- Export game lists using easy-to-create templates.
