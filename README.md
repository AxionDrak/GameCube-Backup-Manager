**GCBM (GameCube Backup Manager)** is a program to work with FAT32, exFAT and NTFS drives *(NTFS devices only work as a backup, they don't work on Nintendont)* allowing you to correctly convert ISO files for use on Nintendont.

### Notes

+ The Wii and Wii U SD card slot is known to be slow. If you're using an SD card and are having performance issues, consider either using a USB SD reader or a USB hard drive (Highly recommended!).
+ USB flash drives are known to be problematic.
+ Nintendont runs best with storage devices formatted with 32 KB clusters. Use either FAT32 or exFAT (FAT32 highly recommended!).
